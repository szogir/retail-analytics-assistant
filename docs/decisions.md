# Design decisions

Short records of the main decisions: the context, what was decided, the
alternatives that were considered, and the consequences.

## 1. Local DuckDB instead of a cloud data platform

**Context.** The demo must run on any machine with a single command, so a reviewer
can clone it and try it in minutes. At the same time the SQL should feel like a
modern analytical platform.

**Decision.** Use DuckDB with a single database file, opened read-only.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *PostgreSQL* - has real row-level security, but needs a running server and is an OLTP engine.
- *SQLite* - zero setup, but weak analytical SQL.
- *A managed lakehouse (e.g. Databricks)* - closest to a real enterprise setup, but not
  reproducible without an account.

**Consequences.** DuckDB has no built-in row-level security, so permissions are
simulated with per-user filtered views (see decision 3 once added). In production
this would be handled by the data platform itself, using the end user's identity.

## 2. A thin, own LLM interface instead of an agent framework

**Context.** The pipeline is a short, fixed sequence of steps. Each step should be
testable on its own, and the model provider should be replaceable.

**Decision.** Define a small `LLMClient` protocol and implement one adapter per
provider using the official SDKs. No LangChain / LlamaIndex.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *LangChain / LangGraph* - many ready components and agent state machines, but more
  abstraction than a four-step chain needs.
- *LiteLLM* - one call signature for many providers, but hides provider-specific
  behaviour (structured output, prompt caching) that matters here.
- *Pydantic AI* - a good, typed, model-agnostic option; the main alternative if the
  own layer grows.

**Consequences.** Slightly more code to write, but every step is visible, testable
with a fake client, and swappable through configuration.

## 3. Command-line interface first, API and UI later

**Context.** The available time is short. The most valuable evidence is measured
accuracy and enforced permissions, not a polished interface.

**Decision.** Ship a CLI (`typer` + `rich`) that calls the pipeline directly.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *FastAPI + Streamlit* - the target architecture, but it would take time away from
  evaluation and safety work.
- *Notebook demo* - fast, but not testable or operable.

**Consequences.** The pipeline is a plain function with a clean boundary, so an API
layer can be added without changing it.

## 4. Synthetic data with a shifted fiscal year

**Context.** The project must show that a semantic layer measurably improves accuracy.
That needs data where the correct answer is known and where the classic traps exist on
purpose. Real or public retail data cannot guarantee that, and has licence limits.

**Decision.** Generate fictional data with a fixed seed. Conventions:
- The fiscal year starts on 1 March and is named after the calendar year in which it
  starts (2025-03-01 .. 2026-02-28 is fiscal year 2025). `fiscal_month` is 1..12 with
  March = 1. `fiscal_week` counts 7-day blocks from the fiscal year start (1..53).
- VAT rates differ by country and product category. They are simplified and are not
  tax-law references.
- The catalogue and the store list are fixed tables, only base prices are random.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *Public datasets* - no known traps, no two-currency or per-store structure.
- *Faker-generated names* - unrealistic names, no matching EN/HU pairs, extra dependency.
- *Fiscal year = calendar year* - the `fiscal_*` columns would add nothing to test.

**Consequences.** Measured accuracy is an upper estimate: real data is noisier. This
goes into the README limitations.
