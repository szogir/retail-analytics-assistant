# Design decisions

Short records of the main decisions: the context, what was decided, the
alternatives that were considered, and the consequences.

## 1. Local DuckDB instead of a cloud data platform

**Context.** The demo must run on any machine with a single command, so a reviewer
can clone it and try it in minutes. At the same time the SQL should feel like a
modern analytical platform.

**Decision.** Use DuckDB with a single database file, opened read-only.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *PostgreSQL* - has real row-level security, but needs a running server and is an OLTP engine.
- *SQLite* - zero setup, but weak analytical SQL.
- *A managed lakehouse (e.g. Databricks)* - closest to a real enterprise setup, but not
  reproducible without an account.

**Consequences.** DuckDB has no built-in row-level security, so permissions are
simulated with per-user filtered views (see decision 3 once added). In production
this would be handled by the data platform itself, using the end user's identity.

## 2. A thin, own LLM interface instead of an agent framework

**Context.** The pipeline is a short, fixed sequence of steps. Each step should be
testable on its own, and the model provider should be replaceable.

**Decision.** Define a small `LLMClient` protocol and implement one adapter per
provider using the official SDKs. No LangChain / LlamaIndex.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *LangChain / LangGraph* - many ready components and agent state machines, but more
  abstraction than a four-step chain needs.
- *LiteLLM* - one call signature for many providers, but hides provider-specific
  behaviour (structured output, prompt caching) that matters here.
- *Pydantic AI* - a good, typed, model-agnostic option; the main alternative if the
  own layer grows.

**Consequences.** Slightly more code to write, but every step is visible, testable
with a fake client, and swappable through configuration.

## 3. Command-line interface first, API and UI later

**Context.** The available time is short. The most valuable evidence is measured
accuracy and enforced permissions, not a polished interface.

**Decision.** Ship a CLI (`typer` + `rich`) that calls the pipeline directly.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *FastAPI + Streamlit* - the target architecture, but it would take time away from
  evaluation and safety work.
- *Notebook demo* - fast, but not testable or operable.

**Consequences.** The pipeline is a plain function with a clean boundary, so an API
layer can be added without changing it.
